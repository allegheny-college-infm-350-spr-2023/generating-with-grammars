## Summary

To this point in our work together, we've established and broken apart our understanding of the ways in which meaning occurs in a generative text. In this assignment, we'll explore building up our knowledge again using language as a kind of symbol. Here, however, we're interested in the ways that symbols combine to genereate text that engages in meaning-making by employing patterns of semantic sense that we define as "grammar."

Traditionally, this term is used to both connote and denote agreeements of subjects, verbs, objects, and modifiers. Our organic deployment of this concept often differs from canonical "correct grammar," and our explorations of using grammar apparently "incorrectly" can teach us as much about using its as can being "proper" or "correct."

This assignment asks you to construct and observe the effects of grammars for which you can set the rules, albeit in a somewhat more-or-less automated way.

## Goals

* revisit and expand our definition and understanding of "grammar"
* explore new generative techniques that revolve around the use of _corpora_
* supplementing our understanding of the word "source" in our generative computational context
* expanding our repetoire of techniques toward meaning-making through generative processes

## Outcomes

* 2 poems which engage with our new understandings of "grammar":
  * 1 which manually constructs a generative grammar
  * 1 which uses a Markov chain to combine no fewer than `2` source texts

Each of these pieces should be discussed in an individual [`reflection.md`](writing/reflection.md) document that explores a few questions relating to _both_ pieces and your own comparison of the two.


## Process

This work can be completed locally using `nodeJS`, but can also be achieved using [`p5.js`](https://p5js.org/) for visual elements. If using `p5.js`' online editor, paste your links in the following table:
